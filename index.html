      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>My name is Geordin. Online I go by GormTheWyrm. <br>You may know me as Gorm. </p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Hatched in rural New England, raised among the hillfolk.</p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>

      <p>An avid bookwyrm, I enjoy reading, exloring and participating in medieval and renaisance festivals.
        One day I hope to create my own fantastical realm for others to explore.</p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

      <p>I would love to create immersive fantasy, though I have not figured out the medium yet. Book, TV, RPG or other medium, I see myself working with story and shaping a narrative.</p>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <p>I currently live in the state of Virginia, within the United States. For the SCAdians out there, that is the Kingdom of Atlantia.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>

      <p>I like to help others reach their dreams. <BR>
        Also, as an avid Bookwyrm, I have an innate desire to expand my Domain.
        No, you know what; its for the puns. I live for the puns. I breath for the puns. Soon I will take over the web and the entire world will be awash in puns!
       Bwahaha!
